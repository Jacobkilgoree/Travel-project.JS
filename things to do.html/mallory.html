<a>The Mallory Kountze Planetarium located in the heart of the Durham Science Center, on the UNO campus, is an exciting place to go for star shows, lectures, and possible rooftop observing! The Planetarium has Space Telescope Science Institute's "ViewSpace" display next to its entry. ViewSpace is updated daily from STScI with the latest images and content from Hubble Source. As you wait for a planetarium show or just walking through the Durham Science Center, learn a little about what's happening in space.
