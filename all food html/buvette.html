<A>La Buvette is a unique, intimate wine bar and grocery in the Old Market area of downtown Omaha.  We offer a French menu, bar, grocery, bread baked daily, and an extensive wine selection. Since owners Mark and Vera Mercer opened La Buvette in 1991, the cafe has been, at its heart, a reflection of the diverse Old Market neighborhood, drawing residents young and old for social gatherings and intimate conversations.

  Come in, have a seat.  Browse the bottles of wine – feel free to bring one to your table to drink.  We serve a two part menu – one side of our menu is available every day, the other side features daily specials.  From Boeuf Bourguignon to roasted beets with goat cheese, anchovies, and house vinaigrette, we serve many dishes that can’t be found anywhere else in Omaha.
  
  Our menu is served from 11:30 am daily until one hour before closing, with drink and bar service available throughout. Weekends are busy, and good weather brings out the locals to enjoy the outdoor seating. The wine list and daily food offerings are evolving constantly, under the supervision of chef Julie Friederich, manager Darech Gaskill, and owner Mark Mercer.
  
  We offer walk-in service only, no reservations, and do not do delivery or take out orders.  We do, however, offer grocery and deli items to take home such as cheese and charcuterie by the pound, bread made daily from scratch by baker Keith Friederich using Parisian methods, olives, vinegars, oils, and more.  Enough for the perfect picnic basket or romantic dinner.
