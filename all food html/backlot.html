<a>With its crispy, caramelized cheese crust and sauce on the top -- Backlot's signature deep-dish, Detroit-style square pizza is a show stopper. How do we do it? Our Sicilian-style dough gives it a light, airy base similar to focaccia bread, making it the perfect base for our specialty toppings.

  Taste beyond the pie with Backlot's selection of classic favorites, including stacked burgers, fresh salads and light wraps. Pair with any of the local and domestic brews for a combination that will leave you "thanking the Academy."
